# Online Book Swap Portal

An online web application that allows users to list, browse, and swap books with others. Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React, the system supports user authentication, book management, swap requests, transaction logging, notification and messaging.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and provide secure access.
- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and view books.
- **Book Swapping**: Request swaps, accept or cancel them, and track swap status.
- **Notifications**: Get alerts when a swap is matched or updated.
- **Transaction Logging**: All swaps are recorded for traceability.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment via GitHub Actions.

## GitHub Version Control

- Main branch contains stable production-ready code.
- Feature branches were used for each new functionality.
- Pull requests were submitted for code reviews and merging.
- GitHub repo: [https://github.com/niceenb/bookswap]

## CI/CD Workflow

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD:

1. **On Push to `main` branch**:
   - Backend & frontend dependencies are installed (`npm ci`)
   - Tests are run (`npm test`)
   - Build is created for production
   - Deploys to the EC2 server via SSH

2. **Deployment Server**:
   - **Process Manager**: PM2
   - **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx
   - **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

## Local Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository and setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niceenb/bookswap.git

cd bookswap
```

**Backend Setup**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**Frontend Setup**
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Create environment variable files

Create .env file in backend folder and put
Please find the username and password in the report

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@cluster0.gi0e16z.mongodb.net/BookSwap?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
JWT_SECRET=2J8zqkP7VN6bxzg+Wy7DQZsd3Yx8mF3Bl0kch6HYtFs=

```

### 3. Run the application locally

**Start backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Start frontend**
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm start
```


<!-- **Assessment 1 (Total Marks **20**)**

Assignment: **Software requirements analysis and design (**Full-Stack CRUD Application Development with DevOps Practices**)**


---

**Objective**

You have been provided with a starter project that includes user authentication using Node.js, React.js, and MongoDB. Your task is to extend this application by implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations of different featuresfor a real-world application of your choice, while following industry best practices such as: 

* **Project Management with JIRA**
* **Requirement Diagram**, **Block Definition Diagram (**BDD), Parametric Diagram using**SysML**
* **Version Control using GitHub**
* **CI/CD Integration for Automated Deployment**

---

**GitHub link of the starter project: **[https://github.com/rajuiit/sdlapps](https://github.com/rajuiit/sdlapps)

---

**Requirement**

1. **Choose a Real-World Application**

We will send you an email to choose a Real-World project. If you face any difficulties in choosing your project, please contact your tutor.

2. **Project Design with SysML and Project Management with JIRA**

* Draw a requirements diagram, Block Definition Diagram (BDD), and Parametric Diagram based on your project (Connect all functional features).
* Create a JIRA project and define:
  * Epic
  * User Stories (features required in your app)
  * Child issues or Subtasks (breaking down development work)
  * Sprint Implementation (organizing work into milestones)
* Provide your JIRA board URL in the project README.

**3. Backend Development (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)**

* Set up and configure the MongoDB database connection.
* Implement various backend functions for handling application data.Ensure that all functions are compatible with an Application Programming Interface (API) structure(Follow existing patterns used in the Task Manager App where applicable).
* Implement CRUD operations forcreating, reading, updating, and deleting records for each functionality.

4. **Frontend Development (React.js)**

* Create a user-friendly interface to interact with your API endpoint (Follow task manager app).
* Implement different forms for adding, updating, and deleting records.
* Display data using tables, cards, or lists (Follow how we showed data in task manager app, try to implement better visualization for the frontend.)

**5. Authentication & Authorization** (Prerequisite Task)

* Ensure only authenticated users can access and perform CRUD operations. (Already developed in your project)
* Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication (Use the task manager one from .env file).

**6. GitHub Version Control & Branching Strategy**

* Use GitHub for version control and maintain:
* main branch (stable production-ready code)
* Feature branches for each new feature
* Follow proper commit messages and pull request (PR) for code reviews.

**7. CI/CD Pipeline Setup**

* Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to:
* Automatically run tests on every commit/pull request (Optional).
* Deploy the backend to AWS. (Use the QUT provided EC2 instance)
* Deploy the frontend to AWS.
* Document your CI/CD workflow in the README.

---

**Submission Requirements**

**A report **contains** the following (Provide screenshots as evidence for each implemented task. **The screenshot should **contain** your username** from JIRA, GITHUB, and AWS**):

* **JIRA Project **Management**(Provide screenshots in the **report o**f at least two epics**, **including user story, sub**t**a**sks**. **Please **donâ€™t** provide **the **U**ser Authentication** epic**.**Provide your JIRA Board URL in the report and README file as well.**Through the JIRA Board, we will systematically review the completeness of the project features, organised under Epics, User Stories, and Sub-tasks.**
* Requirement diagram, Block Definition Diagram (BDD), Parametric Diagram (Using project features).
* **GitHub Repository (backend/ and frontend/)** link. We will **review** your code implementation, which you followed from the task description. We will also **review** your commits, main branch, feature branches, and pull requests. **(**Please note that the authorisation** (Log In, Registration)** is the prerequisite for backend development.**)**
* CI/CD pipeline details step by step screenshot.
* README.md with:
* Project setup instructions.
* Public URL of your project.
* Provide a project-specific username and password if we need to access your dashboard.

---

**Assessment Criteria:**

* Clarity and completeness of Jira board and SysML models.
* Adherence to Git best practices and practical contributions.
* Successful implementation, deploymentand CI/CD pipeline.
* Problem-solving skills and the ability to go beyond basic requirements. -->
